### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Welcome!
* As you can see, this special README.md was created accidentally when I create a repository named _efJerryYang_.
* Ha, a surprise, right?

## Who I am?
* My name is Jerry Yang, direct transliteration of my Chinese name. _ef_ is short for Eternal flames, inspired by Rowling's harry potter series: the goblet of fire (the 4th one).
* A student currently studying computer science in HITSZ in China.
* Hmmm, started to watch an anime, vivy, a quite interesting story about AI to destroy AIs. (Actually, my second watched anime, the previous one is Pokemon.
