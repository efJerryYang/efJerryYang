### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## Welcome!

## Who I am?

- I'm Jerry Yang, currently a CS student at HITSZ.
- Especially interested in nlp but still in general practice with deep learning, and may start learning about cybersecurity in the next few months.
- Hope to make a little money using automatic trading strategies - maybe build a stock trading bot?
- Keep up with the latest news about protein design!
